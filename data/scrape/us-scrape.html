<li>A 5-year-old died in New York City on Thursday from what appeared to be a rare syndrome linked to the coronavirus that causes life-threatening inflammation in children [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/health/kawasaki-disease-covid-coronavirus-children.html" style="cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">learn more</a>] [<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31094-1/fulltext" style="cursor: pointer;">study</a>], New York State Governor&nbsp;Andrew M.

This is at least the second death reported worldwide so far&nbsp;after that of a 14-year-old boy in England, according to a study published on May 7 in the journal Lancet [<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31094-1/fulltext" style="cursor: pointer;">source</a>].<br />

On April 27, the UK NHS had alerted about the new illness, with at least 12 children in the UK requiring intensive care, and an<strong>&nbsp;estimated &quot;4.5 cases for every 100,000 children under the age of 18 in the UK</strong>&quot; [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus" style="cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">source</a>].

As of Jan. 31, the Wuhan coronavirus is officially a public health emergency in the United States, Alex Azar, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announced at a White House press briefing.</li>
<li><img src="/img/alert.png" width="16" height="16"> On Jan. 31, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <strong>issued a federal quarantine for 14 days</strong> affecting the 195 American evacuees from Wuhan, China. Starting Sunday, Feb. 2, U.S. citizens, permanent residents and immediate family who have visited China's Hubei province will undergo a <strong>mandatory 14 days quarantine</strong> and, if they have visited other parts of China, they would be screened at airports and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. The last time the CDC had issued a quarantine was over 50 years ago in the 1960s, for smallpox.</li>
<li><img src="/img/alert.png" width="16" height="16"> President Donald Trump signed an order on Jan. 31 for the U.S. to<strong> deny entry to foreign nationals who traveled to China</strong> within the preceding two weeks, aside from the immediate family of U.S. citizens.</li>
<li>On Jan. 30, the CDC had confirmed the<strong> first case of person to person transmission in the U.S.: </strong><strong><sup>[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</sup></strong> the husband of the Chicago, Illinois case who had returned from Wuhan, China on Jan. 13 and who tested positive for the virus on Jan. 24).</li>
<li>CDC stated on Jan. 30 that &quot;It is likely there will be more cases of 2019-nCoV reported in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks, including more person-to-person spread.&quot;<strong><sup>[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</sup></strong></li>
<li>The virus had been confirmed in <strong>5 states</strong>.</li>

On Feb. 1, however, the city's health commissioner did report that there was a test being performed on a person under 40 who had returned from China, developed matching symptoms, and tested negative to the seasonal flu.</li>
<li><strong>Most US patients had recently visited Wuhan</strong>.</li>
<li>All of the first five U.S. cases were described as <strong>mild</strong>.</li>
